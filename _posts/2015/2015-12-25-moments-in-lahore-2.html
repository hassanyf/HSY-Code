<h2>Time For A Reboot</h2>

<section class="intro">New logo, new website, new everything... Why? Around 3 years ago I started highpload, a file uploading website that I wanted to use for uploading. And then I moved from Kuwait to Pakistan for my studies and the site got very little attention, honestly I gave myself and the people around me very little attention. And that wasn't fair to me or anyone else for that matter.</section>

<p class="close">So it's time for a reboot and this time around I'm doing it right. I'm going to tell you my story and how I get to work with some amazing friends, and live a very free lifestyle. I'll be taking my trusty camera with me so I can document the weird and amazing things I get to see and experience too.</p>

<p class="close">So if you want to know how to handle Kuwaiti visas like a boss, like looking at pretty pictures, love travel, appreciate good design or if you just want to know how I look at the world then this is a blog you'll love reading.</p>
